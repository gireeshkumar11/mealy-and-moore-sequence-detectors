A sequence detector is a digital circuit that identifies a pattern of bits

Sequence detectors are commonly implemented using Finite State Machines (FSMs).

There are two main types:
Moore and Mealy sequence detectors.

1. In a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state.

2. In a Mealy machine, the output depends on the current state and the input.

Sequence detectors can be overlapping or non-overlapping.

Overlapping detectors allow reuse of input bits for detecting consecutive patterns.

Non-overlapping detectors reset after a pattern is detected.

I designed both mealy and moore sequential detectors for the sequence 1001
